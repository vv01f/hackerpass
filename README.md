# Hackerpass

These are the source files for my hackerpass edition. To view and modify the
source files (\*.sla) you will
need to install [scribus](https://www.scribus.net/).

## Why another Hackerpass?

All other hackerpasses I have seen take a very lose approach to design.
I wanted a hackerpass which by design looks more like a real passport and does
not feature any hackerspace logos prominently in its design and thus is neutral.

Additionally, there is no nice looking hackerpass version in german.

## Original Sources

I got the original sources for the hacker passport from
[/dev/tal](http://devtal.de/~nilsarne/Hackerspace_passport.zip),
because the original source link in the Noisebridge wiki was br0ken.

Alternatively you can download the original sources from
[tvbgone](http://cornfieldelectronics.com/downloads/hackerpass/hackerpass.zip).
